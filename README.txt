Welcome to my personal coding portfolio! Here, you can explore a collection of projects Iâ€™ve developed, showcasing my skills in programming, web development, and software design.

Projects Featured
Study Room Reservation: Website for managing room reservations in a University of Washington library. Users can log in, create accounts, search for study rooms, view available rooms, and make reservations.
MiniJava: MiniJava is a subset of the Java programming language designed for educational purposes, particularly for teaching compiler design.
Soccer Match Predictions: This project is a Jupyter Notebook that combines web scraping and machine learning to analyze Premier League data and predict future match outcomes. I developed a data pipeline to collect match stats and team performance metrics, then trained a machine learning model to forecast the probable results of upcoming games. This project showcases skills in data extraction, feature engineering, and predictive modeling.
